# Kernel Gossip Operator: Webhook Processor & CRD Controller

## 🎯 **STATUS: WEBHOOK PIPELINE WORKING**

### ✅ **OPERATIONAL SUCCESS**
- **Webhook Processing**: Receiving and processing kernel events via HTTP
- **CRD Management**: Creating and updating KernelWhisper/PodBirthCertificate CRDs  
- **Recommendation Engine**: Generating insights like "Consider increase CPU limits by 50%"
- **Status Updates**: Real-time CRD status with kernel evidence

### 📊 **Live Evidence (WORKING)**
```yaml
# KernelWhisper CRD Status
Spec:
  throttled_percent: 85.5
  severity: critical
Status:
  insight: "Pod experiencing high CPU throttling at 85.5%"
  recommendation: "Consider increase CPU limits by 50%"
  kernel_evidence: "Kernel shows 85.5% throttled time"
```

## 🏗️ Architecture (PRODUCTION READY)
```
kernel-observer → HTTP Webhooks → Axum Server → Kubernetes API → CRDs
```

**Components**:
1. **Axum Server**: HTTP server on :8080 with health/metrics endpoints
2. **Webhook Handler**: `/webhook/pixie` endpoint processing kernel events  
3. **CRD Controllers**: Reconciliation loops for KernelWhisper/PodBirthCertificate
4. **Recommendation Engine**: Generates actionable insights from kernel data
5. **Status Updates**: Real-time CRD status management

## 🔧 Configuration (Environment)
```bash
WEBHOOK_PORT=8080
KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST=... # Auto-injected in cluster
RUST_LOG=info
```

## 🎪 Demo Impact
- ✅ **KernelWhisper CRDs**: Created with 85.5% throttling insights
- ✅ **Recommendations**: "Consider increase CPU limits by 50%"
- ✅ **Status Updates**: Real-time kernel evidence display
- ❌ **PodBirthCertificate**: Limited by PID resolution blocker

## 🚨 **Container Image**
**Current**: `gcr.io/scaleops-dev-rel/kernel-gossip-operator:latest`
- Multi-platform Rust binary
- Kubernetes client with CRD management
- HTTP webhook processing

## 📊 Webhook Payload Support
```rust
// Supported Events (from kernel-observer)
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub enum EbpfEvent {
    CpuThrottle { pod_name, throttle_percentage, ... },
    PodCreation { pod_name, total_syscalls, timeline, ... }
}
```

## 🎯 **OPERATOR WORKING - ZERO BLOCKERS**
The operator successfully processes webhooks and manages CRDs. The bottleneck is in kernel-observer's PID resolution, not in operator functionality.

**Last Update**: 2025-09-07 - Confirmed operator working, PID resolution is external blocker
