# Kernel Gossip: Your Infrastructure is Talking Behind Your Back!
## CDS 2025 Talk Script & Outline

---

## 🎯 Opening: The Problem (2 mins)

### The Lie We've Been Living
"Let me start with a confession: Your Kubernetes metrics are lying to you."

**[SLIDE: kubectl top pod showing 35% CPU usage]**

"You see this? kubectl top pod shows 35% CPU usage. The Metrics API - Kubernetes' built-in metrics source - reports everything is fine. But here's what's actually happening..."

**[DEMO 1: Show real throttling]**
```bash
kubectl get kernelwhisper nginx-kw -n kernel-gossip -o yaml
# Shows: 85% throttling detected by eBPF
```

"The kernel sees 85% throttling! Your pod is gasping for air while Metrics API says it's barely breaking a sweat."

### Why This Matters
"This isn't just an academic problem. This lie impacts:
- **Performance**: Your apps are slower than they need to be
- **Stability**: Unpredictable throttling causes mysterious latency spikes
- **Scaling**: HPA scales based on lies, VPA recommends based on fiction
- **Cost**: You're either over-provisioning or under-performing"

"And it gets worse with Kubernetes resource management:
- **Limits**: Create invisible ceilings your metrics can't see
- **LimitRanges**: Enforce constraints that don't show in monitoring
- **ResourceQuotas**: Add another layer of hidden restrictions"

## 🔍 Part 1: Kubernetes → Kernel Translation (5 mins)

### What Really Happens When You Deploy a Pod

"When you `kubectl apply`, Kubernetes doesn't talk directly to the kernel. There's a whole translation layer..."

**[SLIDE: Architecture diagram showing K8s → CRI → containerd → runc → kernel]**

"Let me show you what REALLY happens when a pod starts:"

**[DEMO 2: Pod Birth Certificate]**
```bash
# Deploy a new pod
kubectl run demo-nginx --image=nginx:alpine

# Watch the kernel truth
kubectl get podbirthcertificate -n kernel-gossip
```

"Look at this! 847 syscalls just to start nginx! The kernel shows us:
- Clone operations for namespace creation
- Unshare calls for isolation
- Mount operations for filesystem setup
- Cgroup writes for resource limits"

**[Show actual timeline from CRD]**

"This is the real conversation between Kubernetes and Linux - captured by eBPF."

## 💡 Part 2: The Solution - eBPF Architecture (5 mins)

### Traditional Monitoring vs Kernel Truth

"Sure, you could use Prometheus + Grafana. But:
- Complex setup and maintenance
- Still relies on cAdvisor/kubelet metrics
- Adds latency - scraping intervals
- Misses kernel-level events entirely"

### Our eBPF Solution

**[SLIDE: Architecture diagram]**

```
Kernel Events → eBPF (bpftrace) → Rust Parser → Webhook → Operator → CRDs
```

"Here's our approach:
1. **eBPF Programs**: Attach directly to kernel tracepoints
2. **Real-time Processing**: Events processed as they happen
3. **Smart Webhook**: Enriches data with Kubernetes context
4. **CRD Storage**: Native Kubernetes resources you can query"

**[Show actual code snippet]**
```rust
// Actual eBPF program watching CPU throttling
tracepoint:sched:sched_switch {
    // Track context switches - the REAL CPU pressure
    @switch_counter++;
    if (@switch_counter % 1000 == 0) {
        printf("CPU_THROTTLE_EVENT pid=%d throttle_ns=%llu\n", 
               args->next_pid, nsecs);
    }
}
```

## 🎪 Part 3: Live Demonstrations (8 mins)

### Demo 1: CPU Throttling Detection

```bash
# Deploy a CPU-intensive workload
kubectl apply -f k8s/workloads.yaml

# Generate load
kubectl apply -f k8s/ddosify-load.yaml

# Watch the lie unfold
kubectl top pod nginx-monitored
# Output: cpu: 350m (35%)

# Now see the truth
kubectl get kernelwhisper nginx-kw -n kernel-gossip -o yaml
```

**[Show output highlighting]**
- Metrics API: "35% CPU usage"
- Kernel Truth: "85% throttling, 129,000 context switches"
- Recommendation: "Increase CPU limits by 50%"

### Demo 2: Pod Creation Timeline

```bash
# Create a pod and watch its birth
kubectl run test-pod --image=nginx:alpine

# See the syscall cascade
kubectl describe podbirthcertificate test-pod-cert -n kernel-gossip
```

**[Show timeline]**
"Look at this timeline:
- T+0ms: Clone for PID namespace
- T+10ms: Unshare for network isolation  
- T+25ms: 47 mount operations for rootfs
- T+95ms: Cgroup writes for resource limits
- T+120ms: Exec into main process"

### Demo 3: Real Impact on Autoscaling

"Here's where it gets really interesting for production:"

```bash
# Show HPA making wrong decisions
kubectl get hpa
# Current: 2 replicas at "40%" CPU

# Our recommendation
kubectl get kernelwhisper -o jsonpath='{.items[0].status.recommendation}'
# "Scale to 5 replicas based on actual throttling"
```

## 🏗️ Part 4: Implementation Deep Dive (5 mins)

### The Magic: Cgroup-Aware Tracking

"The secret sauce is tracking cgroup events:"

```rust
// Track cgroup attachment for pod UID extraction
tracepoint:cgroup:cgroup_attach_task {
    $path = str(args->path);
    printf("CGROUP_ATTACH pid=%d path=%s\n", args->pid, $path);
    @pid_to_cgroup[args->pid] = $path;
}
```

"We extract pod UIDs directly from cgroup paths - no PID namespace confusion!"

### Production Considerations

"This isn't a toy - it's production-ready:
- **DaemonSet deployment**: Runs on every node
- **Minimal overhead**: <1% CPU for monitoring
- **No kernel modules**: Uses safe eBPF programs
- **Kubernetes native**: CRDs, RBAC, standard patterns"

---

## 🎯 Part 5: Practical Applications (3 mins)

### Use Cases

1. **Right-sizing**: "Stop guessing, start knowing"
2. **Troubleshooting**: "Why is my app slow? Check kernel events"
3. **Cost optimization**: "Remove limits where they're not needed"
4. **SRE automation**: "Auto-remediate based on kernel truth"

### Integration Points

"This integrates with your existing stack:
- Feeds VPA with accurate data
- Enhances HPA decisions
- Exports to Prometheus if needed
- Drives FinOps dashboards"

## 🚀 Closing: The Future (2 mins)

### What We've Learned

"Today we've seen:
1. The Metrics API lie - and why it matters
2. How Kubernetes really talks to Linux
3. eBPF as the truth-teller
4. Real production impact on scaling and costs"

### Call to Action

"Stop trusting the lie. Your infrastructure is already talking - you just need to listen.

The code is open source: github.com/vfiftyfive/kernel-gossip

Three things you can do today:
1. Check your CPU throttling with eBPF
2. Question your resource limits
3. Build observability from kernel up, not metrics down"

### Final Demo Impact

"Remember: We detected 85% throttling while metrics showed 35% usage. 
That's a 50% performance improvement waiting to happen.
In every pod.
In your cluster.
Right now."
