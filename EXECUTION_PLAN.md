# Kernel Gossip Execution Plan

## ðŸŽ¯ Priority Assessment

**CRITICAL for Talk Success (Must Have):**
1. âœ… Operator Core (100% complete) - Full observability pipeline working
2. ðŸš§ Kubernetes manifests - Required to deploy and demo
3. ðŸš§ Demo scenarios - Required for talk demonstrations
4. ðŸš§ Container image - Required for K8s deployment

**IMPORTANT for Production (Should Have):**
5. ðŸš§ Remaining PxL scripts - Enhances demo variety
6. ðŸš§ E2E tests - Ensures reliability  
7. ðŸš§ CI/CD pipeline - Production readiness

**NICE TO HAVE (Could Have):**
8. Performance optimization
9. Advanced monitoring
10. Extended documentation

## ðŸ“‹ Detailed Execution Plan

### ðŸŽ¯ Phase 5A: Kubernetes Deployment (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Goal**: Enable deployment and basic demo

#### Task 1: Create Kubernetes Manifests
- **CRD Definitions**: Export PodBirthCertificate & KernelWhisper CRDs to YAML
- **Operator Deployment**: Deployment, Service, ConfigMap, RBAC
- **Test Workloads**: Demo applications that trigger kernel events
- **Namespace**: kernel-gossip namespace with proper labeling

#### Task 2: Container Image  
- **Dockerfile**: Multi-stage build for optimal image size
- **Registry**: Push to container registry (GCR/Docker Hub)
- **Image Pull Policy**: Configure for development/production

#### Task 3: Basic Demo Scenarios
- **Scenario 1**: Pod Birth Certificate - Show kernel cascade
- **Scenario 2**: CPU Throttle Detection - Show metrics vs kernel truth

### ðŸŽ¯ Phase 5B: Testing & Validation (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Goal**: Ensure reliability and catch integration issues

#### Task 4: E2E Test Framework
- **Test Utilities**: K8s cluster setup, workload deployment
- **Test Scenarios**: End-to-end flows with real Pixie integration
- **Cleanup**: Proper resource cleanup and test isolation

#### Task 5: Integration Testing
- **Pixie Integration**: Test webhook payloads and CRD creation
- **Controller Testing**: Test reconciliation loops with real K8s
- **Status Updates**: Verify CRD status field updates

### ðŸŽ¯ Phase 5C: Enhancement (LOWER PRIORITY)
**Goal**: Complete the full feature set

#### Task 6: Complete PxL Scripts
- **memory_pressure_monitor.pxl**: Detect memory pressure scenarios
- **network_issue_finder.pxl**: Find packet drops and network issues

#### Task 7: CI/CD Pipeline
- **GitHub Actions**: Build, test, and deploy pipeline
- **Quality Gates**: Linting, testing, security scanning

## ðŸš€ Recommended Execution Order

**IMMEDIATE (Next 2-3 sessions):**
1. Create Kubernetes manifests (CRDs, operator deployment)
2. Build container image and test deployment
3. Create basic demo scenarios

**FOLLOW-UP (Next 3-4 sessions):**
4. Implement E2E test framework
5. Complete remaining PxL scripts
6. Add CI/CD pipeline

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics

**For Talk Success:**
- âœ… Operator deploys successfully to K8s
- âœ… Demo scenarios execute smoothly
- âœ… "Wow moments" are clearly visible
- âœ… Backup/recovery plans in place

**For Production Readiness:**
- âœ… All tests passing (unit + integration + E2E)
- âœ… CI/CD pipeline functional
- âœ… Performance meets requirements
- âœ… Documentation complete

## ðŸŽª Demo Readiness Checklist

**Demo Environment:**
- [ ] GKE cluster accessible and configured
- [ ] Pixie installed and webhooks configured  
- [ ] Operator deployed and healthy
- [ ] Test workloads ready to deploy

**Demo Scripts:**
- [ ] Scenario 1: "847 syscalls just to start nginx!"
- [ ] Scenario 2: "Metrics lie - kernel shows 85% throttling!"
- [ ] Recovery procedures if demo fails
- [ ] Backup recordings as failsafe

**Technical Validation:**
- [ ] All components deploy successfully
- [ ] Webhook payloads create CRDs correctly
- [ ] Recommendations appear in CRD status
- [ ] Logs provide clear observability story

This plan prioritizes talk success while building toward production readiness.
